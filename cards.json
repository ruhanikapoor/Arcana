    "meaning_up": "To see the The Fool generally means a beginning of a new journey, one where you will be filled with optimism and freedom from the usual constraints in life. When we meet him, he approaches each day as an adventure, in an almost childish way. He believes that anything can happen in life and there are many opportunities that are lying out there, in the world, waiting to be explored and developed. He leads a simple life, having no worries, and does not seem troubled by the fact that he cannot tell what he will encounter ahead. To meet him in a reading can also be seen as a call to the risk-taking part of your own character. He inspires courage, for he understands that every day is a chance to open up new areas in your life, and with that comes a mixture of anticipation, wonder, awe and curiosity. The Fool is there to show that you can never really tell what lies ahead, and you can only greet it with joy.",
    "meaning_rev": "When you land on the reversed Fool in your reading, you can generally find his more negative characteristics being on display. It can mean that you are literally acting like a fool by disregarding the repercussions of your actions. Like the youth depicted in the card, you don't see how dangerous of a position you find yourself in. A reversed Fool card can show that you are living in the moment and not planning for the future. The reversed Fool meaning serves as caution that you should be more aware so as not to be taken advantage of. Like the dog in the Rider Waite version, this card is here to alert you on anything that may sound too good to be true.",

It might be in your new job, new business venture, a new love or something else. It shows that the time to take action is now and any signs of holding back would mean missing the opportunity of becoming the best version of yourself.

You may be lured in by the showmanship of his arts, but behind that there may be an intention to manipulate for selfish gain. Getting this card might mean that there is someone who pretends to have your best interests at hand when the opposite is true.

In a role reversal, perhaps a reversed Empress is finding her way into your life; it could also mean that you are relying on others to take care of you, and make decisions for you.

It could also be that you are playing the part of a weak ruler, hatching a plan to avoid the tasks that come with having responsibility. Perhaps you aspire for a career that is more flexible than one that is governed by strict rules. Lack of self-control and inability to handle situations can be represented by the Emperor on a personal level. When he is reversed, the structures, rules and systems that he creates are no longer working. His desire to inspire higher principles in his kingdom have turned to ruthlessness, tyranny and rigidity.

It also suggests that you want to stay within certain conventional bounds of what could be considered an orthodox approach. So, instead of being innovative, you will be adapting to certain beliefs and systems which are already put in place and are existing. The Hierophant card suggests that it's better for you to follow social structures which are established and have their own traditions. You might be involved in certain ceremonies, rituals or other religious trappings, for instance.

Like a man that gets lost in his own dreams, the hermit may find himself stuck in a world of his own, alone, trapped, unreal. You must learn to balance your need for truth with connection to your fellow human.

He tends to show up when your mind is filled with one great idea after another, and are unable to progress beyond the beginning planning stages.

However, you should balance it with realistic and well-rounded views. You should also have a plan that takes into account the consequences of your actions. Getting the Knight of Wands in a reading can also mean that there is an event that you don't expect to happen soon.",

    "meaning_up": "The meaning of the upright position of the King of Wands represents pure energy. Unlike the other wands cards in the deck however, this particular one is not focused on pure creativity. Instead, this king is actually way more likely to take an idea and to decisively implement it himself. The King of Wands is a natural born leader of people, and he is also extremely capable. Once the king sets for himself a certain aim or a goal, he is going to conveniently stick to it in order to ensure that it becomes a reality. The King of Wands looks forward to all sorts of different challenges - whether great or small, for he gets a natural adrenaline rush associated with the solving of problems.",
    "meaning_rev": "The negative aspect of the card is associated, as you may guess, with a feeling of arrogance. He can even be rather aggressive in the actual pursuit of his goals, regardless of whether he's actually conscious or not of it. He wouldn't show restraint, nor even the humbleness to know when his assistance isn't actually required. When reversed, the card depicts a personality which is prone to taking rash, impulsive and hasty decisions. This person could be pushy, overbearing as well as dominating at times. Even though he might rarely do this with a sense of malice or with an intention to make someone feel submissive, this is without a doubt a part of his character that one can be frustrated at. In reversal, the card represents the worst spectrum of the qualities of the fire - selfishness and ruthlessness. He can be manipulative as long as you are serving his purpose. With this in mind, the card definitely points out strong and weak aspects, and reflecting on his image can help you dig deeper in your personality.",
